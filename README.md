# Wolfram Physics in Python

I read about Wolfram Physics when it was released and found the ideas very interesting.

I have tried to understand physics from the point of view of a programmer and find the idea of a computational universe very interesting. I have followed Stephen Wolfram's work for some time and have had fun implementing cellular automata. I am not a big fan of his software and prefer to use python.

This is me playing with the ideas presented in his technical documents, using python. The code is incomplete and buggy and represents me trying to work through some of the ideas presented.

Collaborators and discussion welcome.
